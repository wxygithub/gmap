        This is the contents of Tab 1. We created this by listening
        for the "extinfowindowupdate" event on the GMap2 object and 
        manipulating the returned HTML. In this case, we manipulated 
        the returned HTML to creat the effects of tabs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice if you click Tab 2 above you will get some other 
        contents to appear in this area.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="tab1_content">
      <div class="title">Tab 2: tabs continued </div>
      <p>
        Well look at you, clicking tabs to get different content!
      </p>  
      <p>
        Take note that all this content was originally pulled from an ajax 
        request so it won't bog down load time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note that when we set up the tabs we called ExtInfoWindow.resize().
        This helps in case each tab has a different height of it's contents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where to go from here? How about adding effects. You could listen 
        for the extinfowindowupdate and set up your tabs to do transitional
        effects using something like <a target="_blank" href="http://script.aculo.us/">
        Scriptaculous</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://moofx.mad4milk.net/">Moo.fx</a>.  
        It's all in your control now.
