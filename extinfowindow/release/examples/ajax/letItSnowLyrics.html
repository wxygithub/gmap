  "The weather outside is frightful<br />
  But the fire is so delightful<br />
  And since we’ve no place to go<br />
  Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!<br /><br />
  It doesn’t show signs of stopping<br />
  And I’ve bought some corn for popping<br />
  The lights are turned way down low<br />
  Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!"<br />
